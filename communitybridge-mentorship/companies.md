# Companies

You can add your company to CommunityBridge Mentorship so that your company can interview and hire graduates from the Mentorship program. You should request to be added as a company to CommunityBridge Mentorship only if your company can make interview commitments. Interview opportunities occur after a mentee completes/graduates from a mentorship program. The mentor refers a mentee to your company when the mentee’s skills align with the skills your company is seeking. Then your company can reach out to the mentee to discuss an interview for job opportunities. Your company can also sponsor mentorship programs with stipends by providing funding for them. You can use CommunityBridge Funding to provide funding for a project that participates in mentorship program.

You can submit an application form by [creating a company profile](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/docs/communitybridge-mentorship/companies/create-a-company-profile). After Linux Foundation accepts your company profile to Mentorship, your company profile appears on the Companies page of [CommunityBridge Mentorship](https://people.communitybridge.org/).
