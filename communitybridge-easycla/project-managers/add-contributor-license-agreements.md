# Add Contributor License Agreements

As a project manager, you use the CLA Management Console to add CLAs to CLA groups. The CLA Management Console lets you select a template style to use for your Corporate CLA and Individual CLA.

This is a sample sentence.

In some circumstances, you need to change the legal text of the CLA agreement in major and minor revisions:

* A major revision \(for example, a change to your charter\) is one in which you are legally required to have all contributors re-sign the revised agreement.
* A minor revision is one that does not change a legal perspective and contributors do not need to re-sign the revised agreement.

In these cases, you simply add the updated CLA using the same procedure as for adding the initial CLA.
