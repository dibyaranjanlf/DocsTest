​![CLA CLA Group](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LuWIT3NfRhMt-F50U5n%2F-LuXUenJzl7sWiTp19eT%2F-LuXUgYXq_Ll_nt7CN9f%2Fcla-cla-group.png?generation=1574684258854286&alt=media)​

a. Enter a **CLA Group Name**.

The CLA Group Name indicates that a project has one or more CLAs \(Individual CLA, Corporate CLA, or both\). Consider matching the CLA group name to the project name for easy identification.

b. Select the CLA types that you want applied to contributions to the project:

* **Corporate CLA: to be signed by a company** - This Corporate CLA must be signed by the CCLA signatory for your company. This person has authority to enter into legal contracts on behalf of the corporation.
* **Individual CLA: to be signed as an individual contributing** - A developer who is not contributing on behalf of any company signs this Individual CLA. This individual is contributing to a project on their own behalf. Selecting this type automatically enables the "Contributors under Corporate CLA must also sign Individual" CLA type.
  * **Contributors under Corporate CLA must also sign Individual CLA** - Employees \(developers\) of a company use this agreement. A Corporate CLA may not remove the need for every employee to sign their own Individual CLA as an individual. This option covers both owned contributions and not-owned contributions by the corporation signing the Corporate CLA.

c. Click **SAVE**.

The CLA group that you added and the CLA types that you specified appear under CLA Groups.
