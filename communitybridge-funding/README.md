# CommunityBridge Funding

CommunityBridge Funding is a platform that makes it possible for open source projects to raise money via donations from individuals and corporations. The goal behind the crowdfunding effort is to enable projects to pay maintainers and developers for their efforts and project expenses, and to ensure project communities have financial resources to secure, maintain, and advance open source.

Linux Foundation doesn't charge any fees for the first $10M raised through CommunityBridge, which allows developers to use more money to work, drive innovation, sustainability, and adoption.

**Anyone** who is interested in supporting an open source project can learn about CommunityBridge Funding and get involved. Browse through projects and learn about their fundraising goals, donations, expenses, and security vulnerabilities.

**Project Administrators** submit funding applications for financial support from companies and individuals to grow their communities. Project administrators are the primary maintainers of the open source projects on CommunityBridge. [Project administrators can also enroll their projects in a Mentorship program](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/docs/communitybridge-mentorship/administrators/enroll-your-project).

**Backers** and **sponsors** donate money to open source community projects and events.

* Backers are _individuals_ who donate a minimum of $5.
* Sponsors are _companies_ that donate a minimum of $500.

Designated **beneficiaries** get reimbursed for their support of open source community projects and events.

You can participate by applying and submitting your open source project to receive funding through the CommunityBridge platform, as well as by donating to projects, and sponsoring events and travel scholarships.
