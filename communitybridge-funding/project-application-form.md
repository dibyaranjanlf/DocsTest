## Project Beneficiaries <a id="ProjectApplicationForm-ProjectBeneficiaries"></a>

Beneficiaries are individuals who work on a project and then request reimbursement for their time and expenses. If your project participates in a Mentorship program that includes stipends for mentees, add these mentees as beneficiaries.

The following table lists all the fields in the **Project Beneficiaries** panel of the Project Application:

After you enter the name and email address of a person, click **+Add beneficiary** to add the person to the list. To add more beneficiaries, click **+ Add beneficiary** and complete the fields that appear.

When you submit the project, and after the project is approved, the Linux Foundation finance team sets up individual Expensify accounts for each beneficiary. Then, each beneficiary receives an email notification from the finance team that includes a link to their Expensify account. Beneficiaries are invited to join the custom Expensify policy as part of their participation in CommunityBridge. After accepting the invitation, beneficiaries have access to the policy where they can submit expenses for [reimbursement](get-reimbursed.md) from CommunityBridge funds.

The finance team also works with the project administrator to set up a specific expense policy that applies to the project. All the beneficiary and project expenses are gated through the expense policy. For example, the policy might state a hotel price range that is acceptable for a beneficiary or a per diem food allowance.

Only the project administrator can add or remove beneficiaries. The finance team is notified and adjusts the Expensify accounts accordingly.

Annual Project Funding

## Fund Distribution <a id="ProjectApplicationForm-FundDistribution"></a>

**Fund Distribution** enables goals for how you want to distribute funds in your project, and complete the fields that appearâ€”see the example below. Enter a percentage of your Annual Funding Goal amount to designate towards the goal. You can use the up/down arrows to select a percentage also. Be clear to potential sponsors about how you intend to use the funds. You can designate funds towards different types of expenses such as Marketing and Travel. Goal amounts are targets not limits, so you can continue raising money beyond your goal amount. As you see progress in one or more goals, you can \(and should\) update the goals to reflect how you plan to utilize these additional funds.
