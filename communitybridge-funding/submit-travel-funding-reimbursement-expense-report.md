Consider the following financial aspects of reimbursement:

* Linux Foundation CommunityBridge uses [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/), a third-party expense management and payment application. Expensify is an online service application that lets you link your reimbursement account or upload a Wire Transfer form and generate expense reports.

Have these items handy before you begin:

* The amount of the travel funding awarded to you.
* Your receipts converted to USD

You will receive an invitation email from the Expensify Concierge informing you that you have access to the Linux Foundation CommunityBridge policy. Use the same email address linked to your travel funding approval to sign into an existing [Expensify](https://www.expensify.com/) account or set up a new one. If you are using a United States bank, please link Expensify to your bank or financial service account.

The Linux Foundation requires that international \(non-U.S.\) individuals receive reimbursements via wire transfer. Download the attached Wire Transfer form.

Event attendance is required. Expense reports will not be reviewed until after the event has ended.

**How to create your Expense Report:**

1. Go to the Expensify website: [https://www.expensify.com/signin](https://www.expensify.com/signin) Ensure that you use the same email address linked to your travel funding approval.

**To Create or Submit an Expense Report:**

1. Sign In to Expensify
2. Follow the [Expensify procedures](https://docs.expensify.com/en/articles/2921-report-actions-create-submit-and-close) for creating and submitting an expense report. After you submit your report, the approver receives an email notification that your report requires attention. The approver reviews your reimbursement request and approves or rejects it. Next, a Linux Foundation administrator validates the expense and approves or rejects the reimbursement. Expensify funds your account.
3.  Upon approval notification, go to your account to access your reimbursement money. It may take up to 45 business days for the funds to be deposited to your bank account.\*

\*Wire Transfer recipients will get the funds deposited to their account directly from Linux Foundation.
