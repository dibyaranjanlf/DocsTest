# Mentorship Program

This section explains how you can add a mentorship program to your project when you apply for funding. For more details on Mentorship, see [CommunityBridge Mentorship](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/display/DOCS/CommunityBridge+Mentorship).

As a project administrator, you can opt in to the Mentorship program and allocate funds for it while applying for funding your project. You are responsible for developing your own Mentorship program including identifying mentors and mentees, outlining tasks for mentees, and determining stipends and other incentives for participants.
