Travel Scholarship Beneficiaries

After the application is approved, the Linux Foundation finance team sets up an individual Expensify account for each beneficiary. Then, each beneficiary receives an email from the finance team with a notification that includes a link to their Expensify account.

The finance team also works with you to set up a specific expense policy that applies to the Travel Scholarship. All the beneficiary and fund expenses are controlled through the expense policy. For example, the policy might state a hotel price range that is acceptable for beneficiaries or a per diem food allowance.

Only you \(the person who submitted this application\) can add or remove beneficiaries. The finance team is notified and adjusts the Expensify accounts accordingly.

## Travel Scholarship Budget <a id="TravelFundingApplication-TravelScholarshipBudget"></a>

**Annual Travel Scholarship Budget Total** is a total funding budget for the year. The Total Budget is the sum of the individual goal amounts.

## Travel Scholarship Funding Distribution <a id="TravelFundingApplication-TravelScholarshipFundingDistribution"></a>

Enable goals for how you want to distribute funds in your Travel Scholarship fund, and complete the fields that appear—see the example below. Enter a percentage of your Annual Funding Goal amount to designate towards the goal. You can use the up/down arrows to select a percentage also.

Be clear to potential sponsors about how you intend to use the funds. You can designate funds towards different types of expenses. These amounts are targets not limits, so you can continue raising money beyond the designated amount. As you see progress in one or more goals, you can \(and should\) update the goals to reflect how you plan to utilize these additional funds. You can create a custom goal by clicking ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2Flinux-foundation-documentation%2F-M2D_dS1B24qzcG9ihj9%2F-M2DaMshPAAhvdbnoj2e%2F7418652.jpg?generation=1584014141878938&alt=media)​
