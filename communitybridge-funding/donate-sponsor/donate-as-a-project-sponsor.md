# Donate as a Project Sponsor

Select a donation frequency option: One-time or Monthly. **Recurring donations:**

If you choose to donate on a monthly basis, you will be billed upon submitting the donation and will continue to be billed on the first calendar day of each subsequent month thereafter, until you choose to stop the recurring donation. By electing to donate on a recurring basis, you acknowledge that your donation will automatically renew and have a recurring payment feature, and that unless and until you opt out of the auto-renewal of the recurring donation, which can be done through the CommunityBridge Funding service, any recurring donation you have signed up for will be automatically renewed for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the initial term originally selected. In connection with each of your recurring donations, you authorize The Linux Foundation and/or its third-party payment processors to charge your payment method in the amount of the applicable recurring donation and any taxes, fees or other charges. You may cancel your recurring donation by logging into your account and changing your donation settings or by contacting us at [admin@communitybridge.org](mailto:admin@communitybridge.org).
