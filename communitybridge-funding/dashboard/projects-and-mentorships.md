# Projects and Mentorships

Projects and Mentorships detail pages can indicate how active a project is in the open source community. This information can help you decide what particular open source project to participate in or fund. You can also learn about the financial aspects of a project, view how funds are distributed and what the funding goals are. CommunityBridge Funding maintains and displays a transparent ledger of incoming funds \(backer and sponsor transactions\) and outgoing funds \(developer invoices, expenses paid, and so on\) for each project. The Financial tab lists all these transactions with details so that the entire community can view receipts of expenses.

**Do these steps:**

1. 2. From **Projects and Mentorships** tab, Click a **project** or **mentorship** of interest.
3. Browse Dashboard for information. Click the **Financial** tab to see transaction details. **Note:** The Home screen shows the overview of the project.
