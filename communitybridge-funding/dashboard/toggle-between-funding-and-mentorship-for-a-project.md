# Toggle Between Funding and Mentorship for a Project

If a project participates in a Mentorship program, the project is visible on CommunityBridge Funding _and_ CommunityBridge Mentorship. Depending on your role, you use each service and toggle between them for these purposes:

* You can use **CommunityBridge Funding** to raise, allocate, and manage funds for projects including projects that participate in the Mentorship program.
* You can use **CommunityBridge Mentorship** to view, offer, and manage mentorships for aspiring open source software contributors.

You can toggle between projects in Funding and Mentorship at any time, offering you a quick way to go to the project details in either service. For example, go from Mentorship to Funding to view stipend payments listed in the Financial tab of your project.

**To toggle between Funding and Mentorship:**

1. Click **Funding** or **Mentorship** depending on what service you are in:
2. From Mentorship, click **Funding**:
