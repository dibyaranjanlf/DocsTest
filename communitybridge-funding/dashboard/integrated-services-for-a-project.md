## Stacks <a id="IntegratedServicesforaProject-Stacks"></a>

**Stacks** shows crowd-sourced usage metrics about the project. These metrics show the total number of companies and users with their company logos and profile images as well as company and individual apps the project uses as part of their stack. This information is gathered from users who have voluntarily confirmed the use within their private enterprise or public community environments.

## Vulnerability Detection <a id="IntegratedServicesforaProject-VulnerabilityDetection"></a>

**Vulnerability Detection** provides a scanning service to detect vulnerabilities in your project.

The Vulnerability Report shows the severity of vulnerabilities discovered in the project repositories. The National Vulnerability Database \(NVD\) provides CVSS scores for almost all known vulnerabilities, classified into HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW severity for easy prioritization.

Project maintainers can hover over a severity level to log in to Vulnerability Detection and see upstream dependencies, security vulnerabilities, usage reports, and licensing details.
