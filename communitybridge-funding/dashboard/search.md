# Search

Search field allows you to find a project, event, or travel scholarship. Your search looks for items _within_ the tab type. For example, after you select the Events tab, you can search for and find a specific event. If you search for an event when you have the Projects and Mentorships tab selected, the result will be "Items not found" message.

1. To use the search functionality, select the tab for the type of item you want to locate: Projects and Mentorships, Events, or Travel Scholarships
2. Type in a search term for the item you want to locate. You can search by an entire or part of a name, for example: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2Flinux-foundation-documentation%2F-M2D_dS1B24qzcG9ihj9%2F-M2Dc-_V0I9TY3BZC8-d%2F7416595.png?generation=1584014563806158&alt=media)
