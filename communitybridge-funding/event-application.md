After the application is approved, the Linux Foundation finance team sets up an individual Expensify account for each beneficiary. Each beneficiary receives an email notification from the finance team that includes a link to their Expensify account. Beneficiaries are invited to join the custom Expensify policy as part of their participation in CommunityBridge. After accepting the invitation, beneficiaries have access to the policy where they can submit expenses for [reimbursement](get-reimbursed.md) from CommunityBridge funds.

The finance team also works with project administrator to set up a specific expense policy that applies to the fund. All the beneficiary and fund expenses are gated through the expense policy. For example, the policy might state a hotel price range that is acceptable for beneficiaries or a per diem food allowance.

Only the project administrator can add or remove beneficiaries. The finance team is notified and adjusts the Expensify accounts accordingly.

## Event Budget <a id="EventApplication-EventBudget"></a>

**Sponsorship Goal** is a total funding goal amount for the year. The amount is a sum of the individual goal amounts.

Any funds remaining at year end can be carried forward to the next year.

## Fund Distribution <a id="EventApplication-FundDistribution"></a>

**Fund Distribution** enables goals for how you want to distribute funds for your event, and complete the fields that appearâ€”see the example below. Enter a percentage of your total sponsorship goal amount to designate towards the goal. You can use the up/down arrows to select a percentage also.

Be clear to potential sponsors about how you intend to use the funds. You can designate funds towards different types of expenses such as Venue and Travel. Goal amounts are targets not limits, so you can continue raising money beyond your goal amount. As you see progress in one or more goals, you can \(and should\) update the goals to reflect how you plan to utilize these additional funds.
