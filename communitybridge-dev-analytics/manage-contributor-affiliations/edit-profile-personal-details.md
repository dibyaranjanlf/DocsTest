# Edit Profile Personal Details

Edit a profile to add or update contributor information. For example, you want a proper noun to appear in names in dashboards and not a contributor username. You can edit the Name field to the proper nouns, for example: `John Smith` rather than `j_smith`. In another example, you want to mark a profile as a bot to indicate that the activity may not be worth counting. When you [add a dashboard filter](../view-dashboard-analytics/add-and-manage-data-filters.md#AddandManageDataFilters-AddaFilter) to exclude bots, the contributions for this profile are not counted in dashboards.

**Do these steps:**

1. Click a **project** of interest.

2. Click **Affiliation Management**.
