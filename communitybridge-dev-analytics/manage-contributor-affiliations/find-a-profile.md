# Find a Profile

You can search by a name or keyword to find specific profiles. The search results let you identify what data \(for example, Email or Affiliations\) is not provided in a profile, and that you might want to add.

1. Click a **project** of interest.

2. Click **Affiliation Management**. The Affiliation Management Home page shows Search Profiles field.

3. In **Search Profiles** field, enter a **name** or **keyword** and click **Search**.

Profile results show Name, Email, Affiliations, Bot, Country, Last Modified, and \#. The following column headers require explanation:

* Affiliations shows the name of the organization that is affiliated with the profile.
* Number \(\#\) shows the number of identities that are affiliated with the profile.
