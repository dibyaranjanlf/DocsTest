Summary provides a high-level metrics about each data source for which the project is configured. Following are examples of some data sources:

**Highlights** shows the total number of repositories, contributors, and commits for the project.View an example of Highlights section

**Code** shows overview analytics about project commits and contributors:

* **Highlights** shows the number of committers and organizations in the project.
* **Commits** shows a stacked area chart that compares the number of code or issue commits per calendar period. The number of the commits submitted and the contributors who submitted to the project during each period are color-coded. Click **Commits** or **Contributors** to eliminate the corresponding data, for example: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2Flinux-foundation-documentation%2F-M2XlAwbLtYn6J80fL-3%2F-M2XlMYkNZPdDsTAUvZa%2F18088223.png?generation=1584352586962869&alt=media).

* **Top 10 Contributors** lists the top-ten contributors to the project by name, number of commits, and percentage of the total number of commits.

* **Top 10 Contributors** lists the top-ten contributors to the project by name, number of issues submitted, and percentage of the total number of issues. Click **COMPANY** or **INDIVIDUAL** to show the corresponding issue data. A pie chart shows proportional data for the total number of issues per company or individual as a slice of the pie. The pie chart data corresponds to your Contributors selection: COMPANY or INDIVIDUAL. Mouse over a slice to show the number of issues and the company or individual name.
* **Issues** shows a stacked area chart that compares the number of issues and unique contributors per calendar period. The number of issues and unique contributors for the project during each period are color-coded. Click **Contributors \(unique\)** or **Issues** to eliminate the corresponding data, for example: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2Flinux-foundation-documentation%2F-M2XlAwbLtYn6J80fL-3%2F-M2XlMYjJ0CZDJ7IhxDK%2F18088222.png?generation=1584352586978412&alt=media). Click the caption again to include the data.
* **Status** shows a stacked bar graph that compares the number of issues per calendar period. A corresponding table summarizes the issues by status and shows the total number of issues and the percentage of the total issues for each status. The issue statuses are color-coded. Mouse over a color bar in the Status stacked bar graph to show the date, time, and number of issues. Following example shows the statuses as open and closed.
